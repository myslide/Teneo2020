/**
 * This exception is the base class of all exceptions which occur in the mapping process. This class
 * offers automatic logging to commons logging. Note that this class extends RuntimeException, so no
 * forced throws and catch statements. Although there are very differing views on this topic but it
 * is our experience that to many checked exceptions only distract the programmer and have no added
 * value.
